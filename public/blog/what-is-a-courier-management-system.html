<h1>What Is a Courier Management System? A Complete Guide for South African Delivery Companies</h1>

<p>
A <strong>Courier Management System (CMS)</strong> is a software platform designed to help courier companies manage parcel movement, driver routes, deliveries, proof of delivery (PODs), and billing — all in one place.  
In South Africa, where delivery volumes are increasing every year, courier businesses are choosing modern systems like <strong>MM Courier</strong> to reduce delays, eliminate manual work, and improve delivery accuracy.

<h2>Why Courier Companies Need a CMS</h2>

<p>Without a courier management system, companies rely on spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, and manual tracking — which leads to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lost parcels</li>
  <li>Delayed PODs</li>
  <li>Drivers taking long routes</li>
  <li>Poor customer communication</li>
  <li>Incorrect billing and rate disputes</li>
</ul>

<p>
A CMS solves these problems by providing a <strong>central dashboard</strong> to manage all operations.
</p>

<h2>Key Features of a Courier Management System</h2>

<h3>1. Parcel Tracking & Scan Management</h3>
<p>
MM Courier allows staff and drivers to scan parcels at each stage — collection, in-transit, out-for-delivery, and delivered. These updates sync instantly to the cloud.
</p>

<h3>2. Proof of Delivery (POD) Uploads</h3>
<p>
Drivers can upload POD images directly from the tripsheet.  
PODs are automatically linked to the parcel record, preventing lost paperwork.
</p>

<h3>3. Driver Tripsheets & Route Optimization</h3>
<p>
A CMS helps assign parcels to drivers, optimize routes using tools like Google Maps, and monitor delivery performance.
</p>

<h3>4. Client Billing & Rate Automation</h3>
<p>
Courier companies often work with many clients at different rates.  
A CMS calculates correct billing after a valid POD is uploaded — avoiding disputes.
</p>

<h3>5. Customer Notifications & Tracking Links</h3>
<p>
Shippers and recipients get automated updates such as “Out for delivery” or “Delivered with POD”.
</p>
